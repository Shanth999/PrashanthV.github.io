Title: Detection of Possible Illict Messages Using Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision on twitter and Linked Websites
Description: To find a Unknown person who are sending Illegal Messages.Currently, social networks are used to spread this crime through the online environment by using covert messages that serve to promote these illegal services. The images and the URLs found in suspicious messages were processed and classified by gender and age group, so it is possible to detect photographs of people under14 years of age.By applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we are able to recognize gender and age group, taking into account torso information and its proportional relationship with the head, or even when the face details are blurred. As a result, using the SVM model with only torso features has a higher performance than CNN.
